Data Flow

Mock WebSocket Service simulates real-time data updates
Updates are dispatched to the Redux Store via actions
Components subscribe to state changes and re-render accordingly
UI components visualize the data with charts and styled elements

💡 Implementation Notes

The application uses a custom mock WebSocket service to simulate real-time data. In a production environment, you would replace this with a connection to a real cryptocurrency API like CoinGecko, Binance, or CoinCap.
Price changes are randomly generated but follow realistic patterns to simulate market volatility.
The app is optimized for performance with Redux selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
